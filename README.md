# Nature-Scrape

This application uses the BeautifulSoup module to scrape web pages from (Nature.com)[https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?searchType=journalSearch&sort=PubDate&year=2020]. The application takes user input to determine how many pages to scrape and what sorts of articles to scrape. The application uses the os module to create new directories for each web page and saves the body of the pages into text files in these directories based of the article name.
