# Nature-Scrape

This application uses the [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) module to scrape web pages from [Nature.com](https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?searchType=journalSearch&sort=PubDate&year=2020). The application takes user input to determine how many pages to scrape and what sorts of articles to scrape. The application uses the [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) module to create new directories for each web page and saves the body of the pages into text files in these directories based of the article name. I have added some sample files generated by the script for reference.
